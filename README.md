# Iterator Drill: Find

## Learning Goals

* Demonstrate `find()`
* Use `find()` to isolate a specific result

## Introduction

In any programming language, you'll perform operations on arrays. Looking in
an `Array` for a sub string or set of characters is a common task. Sometimes
you need to look for a _specific_ item in the array, and return it. Given a
string or array you can iterate over its elements and perform actions. ES6
introduced a few new `Array` methods--one of them being `find()`.

## Demonstrate `find()`

The `find` function behaves similar to others in JavaScript (like `filter`)
that want a truthy/falsey result. `find` returns the **first**
element for which the function returns true, a single element.

```js
[1,3,5,6,8].find(function(e) { return e % 2 === 0 })
```

**Note**: You could have multiple matches, but `find` returns _only the first
element_. This could lead to some bugs if you're not careful.

```js
let roommates = ["jess", "winston", "winston", "nick"];

roommates.find( function(s) { return s === "winston" })
//=> winston

roommates.filter(function(s) { return s === "winston" })
//=> [winston, winston]
```

## Use `find()` to Isolate a Specific Result

Let's create a function that uses the method `find()` to single out a specific
result in game record data for the football team Kansas City Chiefs. We want to
find out if, at _any_ point in the team's existence, they've had a win in the
Superbowl. Our data looks like this:

```js
const record = [
  {year: "2018", result: "L"},
  {year: "2017", result: "W"},
  {year: "2016", result: "N/A"}
  //...
]
```

Write a function called `superbowlWin()` in `index.js` that:
 * Receives 1 argument, an `Array` of JavaScript `Object`s
 * Each object has two properties: `year` and `result`
 * Use `find()` to test each `Object` to see if the `result` is `"W"` &mdash; a
   win!
 * `superbowlWin()` should return the `year` when the win occurred (if it
   occurred at all!). If no win is found, it should return, sadly, `undefined`

Run the tests using `learn`.

## Conclusion

`Array.find()` is a built-in function in JavaScript which is used to get the
value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided condition.
With this, you can quickly check all the elements of the array and return the
first match.
